==========================
 * From theorem premises:
A B C D E F : Points
C,B,D are collinear [00]
DB = DC [01]
A,C,E are collinear [02]
A,F,B are collinear [03]
E,F,D are collinear [04]

 * Auxiliary Constructions:
: Points


 * Proof steps:
001. A,F,B are collinear [03] & C,B,D are collinear [00] & A,C,E are collinear [02] & E,F,D are collinear [04] ⇒  (BD:DC) * (AF:FB) * (CE:EA) = 1 [05]
002. (BD:DC) * (AF:FB) * (CE:EA) = 1 [05] & DB = DC [01] ⇒  AF:FB = EA:CE
